=====

The simplest and most performing way to start your blockchain development.

This boilerplate allows you to develop decentralized applications on the Ethereum network (and other EVM-compatible blockchains), where we use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for orchestration and compilation of Smart Contracts, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with React for frontend creation and [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) for managing the monolithic repository.

## Features

- Use of **Typescript** in both projects, and generation of Smart Contracts interfaces using **Typechain**.
- Automatic validation using `ESLint` and `solhint` (with integrated Prettier).
- HMR _(hot module reload)_ for Smart Contracts and Frontend.
- Extremely fast compilation thanks to **Turborepo**.
- _(In Progress)_ Automatic frontend interaction for your smart contract.
